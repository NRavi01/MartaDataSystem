To contibute to the codebase, follow the setup procedures!

### Setup
1. Download the latest [Java 8 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html). If you're on Windows, then after downloading it, make sure to add the path to `javac.exe` to your environment variable `Path`. This can be done by first opening up your file explorer, naviagting to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_xxx\bin`, and copying that path. Then hit the Windows key, type in `env`, click on the `Edit  the system environment variables` setting, click on `Environment Variables` near the bottom, click on the `Path` variable, click `Edit`, click `New`, paste in the path you coppied earlier. Now hit `Ok` until all those windows are closed.
2. Download [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). You can download the Ultimate version by verifying that you are a student, but the Community edition should be good enough for this project.
3. Open this project in IntelliJ.
